    "The Black-Scholes equation models the value of European options. One might ask: what is an European option? \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's start from the basics. An option is a type of derivative, but not in the mathematical sense: derivatives are a type of financial contract whose value depends (that is, is <u>derived</u> from!) the value of an underlying asset. While I am ignorant on how many different types of derivaties there exist, there are two that are perhaps the most important and commonly seen: lock and option. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lock products bind the two parties to the terms of the contract. For instance, a contract may dictate that, at a specific future date, party A will buy a X amount of product Y from party B for a total of Z dolars. Examples include future and forwards contracts, which operate similarly to the example above, but differ in that futures are standardized and traded on an exchange, while forwards are effectively private contracts whose terms can be customized by the signatories. \n",
    "\n",
    "Options are somewhat similar, but the party who posseses the option is not required to exercise it. For example, if one has a call option that allows them to buy stock X for $K$ dollars a share, and, at its expiration date, the price of a share is $S<K$, it would be better to not exercise the option. Call options allow one to buy a stock for a pre-determined price (called the strike price) at the expiration date, while put options allow one to sell a stock for a strike price at the expiration date. European options can only be exercise at the expiration date, while Americal options can be exercise at any point prior to the expiration date. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Black-Scholes equation is an attempt to compute values of European options. Seeing as these are a bit more complicated form of derivatives, let's start with the more basic ones: futures."

I think this is something I will have to check out by myself later.
